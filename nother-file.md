Hi. I want to link to the readme I created in the tutorial. So I'm trying out some "github flavored markdown" as described in [this article](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#syntax).
OK, so if you want to view the content as markdown-formatted text in github, you have to use the .md extension. Not surprising. 
So, [here's a link to the readme file](https://github.com/thatgdfox/hello-world/blob/master/README.md) from the same project.
